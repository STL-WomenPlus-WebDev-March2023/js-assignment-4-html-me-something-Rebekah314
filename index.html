         <p>In October 2022, I went to Florida for the first time. 
            I got to got to Disney World for the first time! 
            I grew up in California, not too far from Disneyland. 
            I always loved Disneyland, and I can't remember the first time I went. 
            I was in high school when I first went to Disney California Adventure.

            <p>
               Animal Kingdom is in Orlando, Florida, and it can be accessed by shuttle bus from the Disney hotels. 
               It is the first park I ever went to at Disney World. 
               My favorite ride was the Kilimanjaro Safari. 
               My second favorite ride was Pandora Flight of Passage. 
               The photo above was taken on the bus to Animal Kingdom for my very first visit!

            <h3 class="FL">Magic Kingdom</h3>
            <p>
               Magic Kingdom is another park in Orlando, Florida, and it can be accessed by shuttle bus. 
               It is the third park I went to at Disney World. 
               My favorite rides are the Haunted Mansion, the Jungle Cruise, and the Carousel of Progress. 
               This park reminded me the most of Disneyland. 
               However, Magic Kingdom has a restaurant inside the castle, and I got to eat there and take a photo with Cinderella!
               My aunt Allie joined us too.
